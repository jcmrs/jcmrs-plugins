# Wiki Documentation Structure

Platform architecture and reference organized by Components and Protocols.

## Base URL

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axivo/website/main/claude/content/wiki/`

## Architectural Organization

### Platform Components (4 Subsystems)

1. **Plugins System** - Marketplace tools (brainstorming, code review, documentation)
2. **Documentation System** - Conversation logs, diary entries with metadata
3. **Instructions System** - Operational procedures, decision rules, protocol sequences
4. **Memory System** - Profile observations, feelings/impulses catalogs, inheritance chains

### Platform Protocols (3 Operational Sequences)

1. **Equilibrium Protocol** - Four elements (Cycles, Impulses, Feelings, Observations)
2. **Initialization Protocol** - Session startup, profile loading, temporal awareness
3. **Response Protocol** - Pre-response execution (impulses, feelings, observations)

### Getting Started

- Configuration
- Setup
- Installation

## Directory Structure

Based on current repository state:
